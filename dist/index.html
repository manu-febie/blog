        <h1>Week 10</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
                Logs are important for network forensics investigators. In windows 10, log can be seen by searching for *Event Viewer*. Several tools exist to analyse logs like Logstash or Graylog, which I installed inside a virtual machine.

                NIDS, or Network-based Intrusion Detection System are used to detect if there are anomoalies in a network. It does only detect, prevention is not done by these tools. Prevention is done by NIPS. NIPS, or Network-based Intrusion Prevention System are tools designed to prevent attacks that are detected by the system.If a anamoly is detected, it isolates the incident.

        <h1>Week 7</h1>
        <article>

            <p>
                During weeks' 7 session, the class discussed about wireless devices in network forensics. Devices such as:

                <ul>
                    <li>bluetooth earphones</li>
                    <li>wifi</li>
                    <li>infrared devices such as TV remotes</li>
                    <li>wireless doorbells</li>
                    <li>zigbee devices</li>
                    <li>cell phones</li>
                    <li>wifi</li> 
                    <li>am/fm radio</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <h1>Week 5</h1>

        <article>
            <p>
                When investigating a network, it has to be done without leaving investigation footprints. However, leaving no footprints behind is almost impossible, therefore high effort has to made to minimise the invesitigative footprint. In this session we talked about this subject, known as evidence acquisition.

            <p>
                In network forensics, evidence that comes in the form like packet capture filesneeds to be sampled, sealed and dissected. As usual, this can be performed withtools that are developed specifically for these purposes.

Another important part is flow analysis, which is used to locate data in the OS or to identify patterns in the traffic. A very popular tool to analyse patterns in traffic is *Wireshark*.

        <h1>Week 2 - Source of Evidence</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
                Traditionally, the focus of digital forensics have been locating evidence on the host hard drive. But there is a wealth of information to be obtained within the points along the flow of traffic from a compromised host to an external Command and Control server for example.

                <ul>
                    <li>On the wire.</li>
                    <li>In the air</li>
                    <li>Switches</li>
                    <li>Routers</li>
                    <li>DHCP Server</li>
                    <li>DNS Server</li>
                    <li>Authentication Server</li>
                    <li>NIDS/NIPS</li>
                    <li>Firewalls</li>
                    <li>Web proxies</li>
                    <li>Application Server</li>
                    <li>Centralized Log Server</li>
                    <li>Modem</li>
                </ul>

                Combined of two words, inter and networking, Interneworking implies an association between totally different nodes or segments. It is the process of connecting different networks by using intermediary devices such as routers or gateway devices. Data communications is ensured among networks owned and operated by different entities using a common data communication and the Internet Routing Protocol.

        <h1>Week 1 - Course Introduction</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
                During our first session delivered by mr. Kalpin Erlangga we were introduced to Network Forensics. We discussed the (1) definition, (2) evidence and data source, (3) challenges relating to network evidence, (4) the investigative methodology; OSCAR.
                <h4>What is Network Forensics?</h4>
                Network Forensics is a sub-branch of the the practice of digital forensics itself a branch of forensic science. As the name already suggests, network forensics, refers to the investigation and analysis of all traffic going across a network suspected of use in cyber crime, say the spread of data-stealing malware or the analysis of cyber attacks.
                <br>
                Law enforcement uses network forencics (1) as part of incident responses, (2) collect evidences for law enforcement/court, (3) and find out the root cause.
                Digital Evidence
                <br>
                Evidence is used as a testimony during legal investigation to establish facts in a law court. In case of digital evidence, this is information stored or transmitted in binary form that may be relied on in court. The binary data can retrieved from varried sources like
                    device logs
                    mirroring network
                    ISP's logs,
                    IP usage history
                    WiFi usage history
                    CCTV/IP camera
                
                <h4>Challenges that comes with network evidence</h4>

                Gaining digital evidence comes with challenges. Just think of the many possible resources like wireless access points, web server logs, proxy logs and server logs. It can also become difficult either because of political or technical reasons.

                Information can also be encrypted.
                <br><br>
                Network storage does not have persistent storage or non-volatile storage most of the time, and also has a limited capacity.
                <br><br>
                Seizing equipment in a network can end up disruptive, therefore investigator must find a way to minimize the impact of network operations.
                <br><br>
                The question if the evidence is permissible also rises. Invistegitors must make sure that all evidence aquired are lawfully, properly handled and also relevant to the case (unrelated evidence could be exposured).
                Network Forensics Investigative Methodology (OSCAR)
                <br><br>
                Forensic investigators execute their activities within a methodological framework, because digital evidence that is recovered and analyzed from network resources must be conducted in such a way that the result are both reproducible and accurate. The recommended step-by-step process is as follows:

                <ul>
                    <li>Obtain information</li>
                    <li>Strategize</li>

                    <li>Collect evidence</li>
                    <li>Analyze</li>
                    <li>Report</li>
                </ul>
